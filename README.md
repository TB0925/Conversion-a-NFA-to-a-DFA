# Conversion-a-NFA-to-a-DFA
In Theorem 2.2 of the textbook "An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata" (6th Edition), it is demonstrated that for every nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), there exists an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts the same language. 
The objective of this project is to implement this conversion procedure in Java, which will involve transforming a given NFA into its corresponding DFA, ensuring both automata recognize the same set of strings in the language.
